                This web app will be used by everyday investors who have a
                limited understanding of the technical and fundamental factors
                affecting blue chip stock prices. Our system will provide
                detailed insights into commonly used analysis models—such as
                discounted cash flow (DCF)in order to predict a stock's future
                price. We will differentiate our service from competitors’
                offerings by providing users with transparent metrics that
                explain how we derive our projections. Our goal is to help users
                make better-informed decisions with their investments.
