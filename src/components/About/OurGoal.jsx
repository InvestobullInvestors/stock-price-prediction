            This web app will be used by everyday investors who have a limited
            understanding of the technical and fundamental factors affecting
            blue chip stock prices. Our system will provide detailed insights
            into commonly used analysis models—such as discounted cash flow
            (DCF)in order to predict a stock's future price. We will
            differentiate our service from competitors’ offerings by providing
            users with transparent metrics that explain how we derive our
            projections. Our goal is to help users make better-informed
            decisions with their investments.
